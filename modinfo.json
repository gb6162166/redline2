    "description": "Red Line 2 is aggressive, balanced, and recognizable to all players - no extra learning required. Features optional upgrades to original units, improved units for AI, faster game play, bigger battles, and many new roads to victory. Each unit is put through the same cost model, creating a fun, equally balanced mod for PA Titans with lots of new strategy to explore. Everything is familiar, and plays like the original, letting you jump into action with new tactics.",
